# Vector Database Benchmark Report

## Overview

This report compares the performance of our pure-Python HNSW implementation with Weaviate, a production-ready vector database. The benchmarks focus on measuring:

1. Index build time
2. Persistence (save/load) performance
3. Query latency
4. Search accuracy (recall)

## Test Environment

- **CPU**: [CPU model]
- **Memory**: [RAM amount]
- **OS**: [Operating system]
- **Weaviate Version**: 1.22.4
- **Python Version**: [Python version]

## Datasets

- **Text Embeddings**: [Number] embeddings with dimension [Dimension]
- **Image Embeddings**: [Number] embeddings with dimension [Dimension]

## Configuration

### HNSW Parameters

```json
{
  "M": 16,
  "ef_construction": 200,
  "ef_search": 100,
  "distance_func": "l2"
}
```

### Weaviate Configuration

- Running in Docker
- CPU-only mode (no GPU acceleration)
- Default vector index settings

## Results

### Text Embeddings

| Backend              | Avg. Query Time (ms) | p95 Latency (ms) | Recall@10 |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Pure-Python HNSW     | [Value]              | [Value]          | [Value]    |
| Weaviate             | [Value]              | [Value]          | [Value]    |

**Build Time:**
- HNSW: [Value] seconds
- Weaviate: [Value] seconds

**Persistence:**
- HNSW Save: [Value] seconds
- HNSW Load: [Value] seconds
- Weaviate uses persistent storage by default

### Image Embeddings

| Backend              | Avg. Query Time (ms) | p95 Latency (ms) | Recall@10 |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Pure-Python HNSW     | [Value]              | [Value]          | [Value]    |
| Weaviate             | [Value]              | [Value]          | [Value]    |

**Build Time:**
- HNSW: [Value] seconds
- Weaviate: [Value] seconds

**Persistence:**
- HNSW Save: [Value] seconds
- HNSW Load: [Value] seconds
- Weaviate uses persistent storage by default

### Combined Results

| Backend              | Avg. Query Time (ms) | p95 Latency (ms) | Recall@10 |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Pure-Python HNSW     | [Value]              | [Value]          | [Value]    |
| Weaviate             | [Value]              | [Value]          | [Value]    |

## Analysis
