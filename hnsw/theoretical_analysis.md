# Theoretical Analysis of HNSW

This document provides a theoretical analysis of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm, focusing on its complexity, memory usage, and performance trade-offs.

## Search Complexity

### Theoretical Analysis

The HNSW algorithm achieves O(log N) average search complexity through its hierarchical structure. Here's why:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: The algorithm constructs a multi-layered graph where:
   - The bottom layer (layer 0) contains all N elements
   - Each subsequent layer contains approximately N/M^l elements, where l is the layer number
   - The maximum layer has O(log_M N) elements

2. **Search Process**:
   - Search starts at the entry point in the top layer
   - For each layer, a greedy search finds the closest element to the query
   - This element is used as the entry point for the next layer
   - At the bottom layer, a more thorough search is performed using ef_search candidates

3. **Complexity Breakdown**:
   - Number of layers: O(log_M N)
   - Work per layer: O(M) comparisons (exploring neighbors)
   - Bottom layer search: O(M * log(ef_search)) with a properly tuned ef_search
   - Total: O(M * log_M N + M * log(ef_search)) = O(log N)

The logarithmic complexity is achieved because the hierarchical structure allows the algorithm to "zoom in" on the relevant region of the search space at each layer, effectively reducing the search space by a factor of M at each step.

### Empirical Verification

To verify the O(log N) complexity empirically, we measure search times for different dataset sizes and fit a logarithmic curve to the results. The relationship between search time t and dataset size N should follow:

t = a * log(N) + b

Where a and b are constants. If the empirical data closely follows this curve, it confirms the logarithmic complexity.

## Memory Usage

The memory usage of HNSW can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Vector Data**: O(N * D) where D is the dimension
2. **Graph Structure**:
   - Each element in layer 0 has up to 2M connections: O(2M * N)
   - Each element in higher layers has up to M connections
   - Total number of elements in higher layers: N * (1/M + 1/M² + ...) ≈ N/(M-1)
   - Connections in higher layers: O(M * N/(M-1)) = O(N)
   - Total graph memory: O(2M * N + N) = O(M * N)

3. **Total Memory**: O(N * D + M * N) = O(N * (D + M))

This shows that memory scales linearly with the number of elements N, the dimension D, and the parameter M.

## Performance Trade-offs

### Parameter M (Maximum Connections)

- **Higher M**:
  - Pros: Improved recall, fewer layers needed
  - Cons: Increased memory usage, slower construction time
  - Complexity impact: Reduces the number of layers (log_M N gets smaller as M increases), but increases work per layer

- **Lower M**:
  - Pros: Reduced memory usage, faster construction
  - Cons: Lower recall, more layers needed
  - Complexity impact: Increases the number of layers but reduces work per layer

### Parameter ef_construction

- **Higher ef_construction**:
  - Pros: Better graph quality, higher recall
  - Cons: Slower construction time
  - Complexity impact: No direct impact on search complexity, but improves the quality of connections

- **Lower ef_construction**:
  - Pros: Faster construction
  - Cons: Lower quality graph, reduced recall
  - Complexity impact: May indirectly increase search time due to lower quality connections

### Parameter ef_search

- **Higher ef_search**:
  - Pros: Higher recall, more accurate results
  - Cons: Slower search time
  - Complexity impact: Increases the constant factor in search complexity

- **Lower ef_search**:
  - Pros: Faster search time
  - Cons: Lower recall
  - Complexity impact: Decreases the constant factor in search complexity

## Optimal Parameter Selection

The optimal parameter values depend on the specific requirements:

1. **For maximum recall**:
   - High M (32-64)
   - High ef_construction (200-500)
   - High ef_search (100-200)

2. **For maximum speed**:
   - Lower M (8-16)
   - Moderate ef_construction (100-200)
   - Lower ef_search (20-50)

3. **For memory efficiency**:
   - Lower M (4-8)
   - Moderate ef_construction (100)
   - Adjust ef_search as needed for recall targets

4. **Balanced approach** (to achieve Recall@10 ≥ 0.92):
   - M = 16-24
   - ef_construction = 200-300
   - ef_search = 100-200

## Conclusion

HNSW achieves O(log N) search complexity through its hierarchical structure, making it highly efficient for approximate nearest neighbor search on large datasets. The algorithm offers flexible trade-offs between search speed, memory usage, and recall through its parameters M, ef_construction, and ef_search.

The theoretical complexity is validated by empirical measurements showing logarithmic scaling of search time with dataset size. With proper parameter tuning, HNSW can achieve high recall (≥ 0.92) while maintaining logarithmic search complexity, making it suitable for large-scale similarity search applications.
